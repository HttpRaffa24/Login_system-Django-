# Login_system-Django-
Login system written in django. 
I Implement a basic template of a login system, then you can use the template in any web app with just minimal changes to quickly build the web apps. Nowadays every website requires their customers to create accounts therefore this template will be very useful.
You have to install requirements.txt with this command "pip install -r requirements.txt". Then you can import this login system into your main project. Enjoy :) !!!
